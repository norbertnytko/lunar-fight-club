# Lunar Fight Club - Recruitment Task

## Few words from author

First of all excuse me for poor UI/UX(only included Bootstrap), there is a lot space for improvement, but I have decided to focus more on back-end.

One thing does not meets specification - validate number of skills for fighter

I feel like associations between Fighter and Fight model might be a bit complicated, but I have not figure out better solution yet.

I have tried to stick with RoR convenction that encurage to write thin controllers. I accomplished it by including [`Decent Exposure`](http://decentexposure.info/), I wrote only actions that are required, there is no update and delete actions for both controllers.

Also I wrote one simple decorator.

Settle fight is trivial a this moment, but I see a great way of improvement - more at the end.

##td;dr

I see great way of improving fights.

Characters have 10 points to spent for 2 - 9 skills. Skills have archetype, smiliar to this:

At the start of the fight skills for both fighters are chosen randomly, if skills are the same higher level wins.


Ranking can be improved by implementing Elo rating system.
